CS 3080 final project repository

Summary:
Create a program that scrapes posts from social media platforms, categorizes posts based on the content via Natural Language Processing, and also determines an aggregate "reaction score" based on the comments of the post. Data is retrieved from the social media platforms using "data scraping" APIs and is stored in a backend database. The categorization and scoring is conducted via various data analytics methodologies, and presented to a web server which will provide the user access to the program output.
	
Tasks and Objectives:
- Data scraping 
	- Retrieving data from web using supplied APIs
	- Configuring tool to retrieve relevant content
- Natural Language Processing
	- Analyze data to categorize and classify postings based on content type (news, sports, etc.)
- Classifying how individual words affect score, i.e. which words are positive/negative 
- Backend database services
	- How to efficiently store, query, and access database records
- Client/server network principles
	- Ensure web server has connection to local database to retrieve data
	- Establish and maintain connection to social media platforms
- Web server data presentation
	- Present ideas in a clear, user-friendly method
	- Add visuals and graphs to inform user of results
