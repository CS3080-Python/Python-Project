    <h2 class="overview">Methodology</h2>
    <p>
    Users will be able to query topics in real-time utilizing the Twitter API to retrieve tweets based on chosen topics. Search terms entered into the system will retrieve the most-recent 100 Tweets relating to this topic, and conduct Sentiment Analysis upon the text contained within the Tweets.
    <br>
    <br>
	This program will scrape posts from Twitter and categorize these posts based on the content via
	Natural Language Processing. It will also determine an aggregate "reaction score" based on the comments
	of the post. The data of this program is retrieved via a data scraping API and is stored in a backend database.
	The categorization and scoring is conducted through various data analytics methodologies and is then presented
	to a web server which will provide the user access to the program output. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The sentiment analysis score is prorated to be on a scale that is much lower than the actual precentages. The 
	sentiment meter will work off of a subjectivity score. A tweet is to be considered positive if the analysis yields
	a score greater than one. A neutral score will any score that is between negative one and postive one. Anything less
	than negative one, will give the tweet an overall negative score.
